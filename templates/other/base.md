Please always adhere to our [general guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/guidelines) that apply to all our formats.

Images can come from anywhere, so if we don't have a specific format guide or if you're in doubt stick to a simple format - Header, image description (if any), text transcription, footer.

Whether it's Snapchat, Twitch, Omegle, Tumblr, Instagram or the next social media website that hasn't been invented yet - add the title at the top and take it from there, as neatly as possible. If you're uncertain, feel free to message the mods for guidance or advice, we're here to help!

**tilthingsarebrighter**: "When you dress like that it's like putting a steak in front of a dog; what do you expect?"

Peanut butter is basically my dog's favourite thing in the world.

You know why she's not even touching it?

I said "no."

**Local Guide:** 1 star: The place is neatly kept, friendly staff but we'll overpriced for portion size.

>**Response from the owner**: Our motto is "quality before quantity" We do not serve cheap food! Why did you not complain at time of visit. I would have gladly given you extra at no charge. A bit cowardly of you don't you think?
